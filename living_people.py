'''
Living People: Given a list of people with their birth and death years, 
implement a method to compute the year with the most number of people alive.
You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive).
If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count. 
For example, Person (birth= 1908, death= 1909) is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909.
